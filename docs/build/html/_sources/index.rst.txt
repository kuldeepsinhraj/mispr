=======
Overview
=======
MISPR (Materials Informatics for Structure-Property Relationships) is a
high-throughput computational infrastructure aimed at guiding and
accelerating materials discovery, optimization, and deployment for
liquid solutions by seamlessly integrating density functional theory
(DFT) with classical molecular dynamics (MD) techniques. MISPR is
motivated by the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) principles and is
built on top of open-source Python packages developed for the Materials
Project such as `pymatgen <https://pymatgen.org>`_,
`FireWorks <https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/>`_ ,
and `custodian <https://materialsproject.github.io/custodian/>`_.

Features of MISPR include:

* Automation of DFT and MD simulations and all their underlying tasks from
file management and job submission to supercomputing resources, to output
parsing and data analytics

* Creation of computational databases of force field parameters and DFT
and MD derived properties of molecular systems for establishing
structure-property relations and maintaining data provenance and
reproducibility
